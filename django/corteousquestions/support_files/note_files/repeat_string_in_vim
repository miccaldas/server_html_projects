 If you have abc on a line by itself,
 go to that line and, in normal mode:
 ------------------------------------
 dd50gP
 ------------------------------------
 That is, delete line, set 50 as
 repetition count, paste before
 cursor and move cursor to just after
 the new text (which has an empty
 line that you may or may not want to
 delete).
