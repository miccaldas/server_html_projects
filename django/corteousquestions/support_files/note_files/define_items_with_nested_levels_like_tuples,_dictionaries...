 Sometimes its difficult to access a definition for something
 that is second or third level apart from regular objects.
 Things like tuple elements, list of lists, dictionaries, and
 the like.
 This definition is for a tuple, but it has some ideas to
 retain. First, when you don't define, or can't define, the
 level, represent it with a zero. I didn't know you could do
 that.
 Example from something I was doing for the notes, webapp:
 '/srv/http/notes/resources/homepage_tagging/auto_update/
 tag_is_new_msg.py'

 frst_val = [i[0] for i in lnk_num]
