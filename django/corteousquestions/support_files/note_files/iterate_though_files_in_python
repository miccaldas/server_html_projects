 To iterate through files in a folder, use the
 following formulation to create a list of
 complete URLS for all the files, as an example:
 ------------------------------------------------
 import os

 paths = []
 folder = '/path/to/folder'
 for filename in os.listdir(folder):
     paths.append(os.path.join(folder, filename))
 print(paths)
