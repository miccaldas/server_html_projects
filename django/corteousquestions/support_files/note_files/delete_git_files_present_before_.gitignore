 In case that your repository already has uploads
 like pycache or log files, you can block these
 files in .gitignore, but these won't remove them
 from the repository.
 To do this, first commit all changes to git and 
 then use these commands:
 -------------------------------------------------
 git rm -rf --cached .
 git add .
 git commit ...
