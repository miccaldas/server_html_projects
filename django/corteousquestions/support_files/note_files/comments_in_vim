 I installed a plugin that helps with commenting and
 uncommenting in Vim. The commands are:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 gcc - comment a line
 gc - in visual mode, comments out a section
 gcgc - uncomments adjacent lines
 ----------------------------------------------------
