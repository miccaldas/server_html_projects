 Suppose you are typing a very long command line:<br>
 PATH='/home/alw/bin:/home/alw/bin:/home/alw/bin:<br>
 /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:<br>
 /usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:<br>
 /snap/bin'<br>
 You discover a mistake before you hit Enter. Or<br>
 you discover it later and call the line back in<br>
 your history. You can edit on the command line,<br>
 of course, but if you prefer your editor of<br>
 choice press Control+X Control+E. Your default<br>
 editor (usually set with $EDITOR or $VISUAL)<br>
 will start with the command loaded.<br>
