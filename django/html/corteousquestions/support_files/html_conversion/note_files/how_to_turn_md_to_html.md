 This is the process to turn to html<br>
 the original markdown files. After<br>
 building the corteousquestions.club<br>
 to substitute the <br>
 constantconstipation.club blog, that<br>
 was terminated as it was predicated<br>
 in using static site platforms to <br>
 build it and serve it, and since<br>
 finding out that, for all the trouble<br>
 it gave, you're better off just<br>
 doing everything by yourself.<br>
 Because of slowness on the server, I<br>
 recommend that post manipulations be<br>
 be done in home computer, and then<br>
 send only the files on the 'public'<br>
 folder.<br>
 After some time finding a good<br>
 converter from md to html, and after<br>
 kissing many frogs, I decided to use<br>
 pygmentize. Who had the added<br>
 advantage of already being installed.<br>
 This is the command:<br>
 &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;<br>
 pygmentyze &nsbp;f html &nsbp;o \<br>
 <new&nsbp;html&nsbp;to&nsbp;create> <old md file><br>
 &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;<br>
 After that it's needed to insert this<br>
 new html into the post template created.<br>
 This couldn't be done on site, as was<br>
 taking too much time on site.<br>
 After that it's necessary to upload the<br>
 files to the server, create new entry on<br>
 the index page, and that is all she wrote.<br>
