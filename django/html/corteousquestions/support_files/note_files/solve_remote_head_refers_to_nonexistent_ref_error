 If a repository is initiated with the default branch as "main",
 it generates the following error, when doing "git clone":
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 In this case, and contrary to what you'd expect to happen, the
 solution is to revert to calling the default branch, "master".
 This can be done in this fashion:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 git branch -m main master
 git push -u origin master
 git push origin --delete main
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
