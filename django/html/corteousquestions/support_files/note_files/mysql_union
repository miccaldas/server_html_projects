 To add the content of several columns into one column, use
 the 'Union' operator. An example:
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 SELECT k1 FROM notes SELECT k2 FROM notes;
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 You can add as much as you want. It returns a unique
 column, with no repeats.
