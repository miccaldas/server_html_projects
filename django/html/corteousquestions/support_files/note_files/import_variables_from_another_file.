 Much to my surprise, it's possible to import
 a variable, and only that,if you want to,
 from another module.
 You just import it as you would a function:
 -------------------------------------------
 from <other_file> import <variable_name>
 ------------------------------------------
 or
 ------------------------------------------
 import <other_file>
 ------------------------------------------
 If you want access to everything.
 I've tested it and it works OK. It might
 need the creation of a __init__.py file, 
 but I don't think that's a thing right now.
