 The Vim versions from aur or even the github one, are not
 what I want from Vim. To ensure that there is all I need.
 The only solution is to download from GitHub and configure
 with this flags:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 ./configure --with-features=huge -enable-gui --with-x
 ---------------------------------------------------------
