<p>1 - ‘Data Science in the Command Line’:<br><strong>“This book is about doing data science at the command line.</strong><br><strong>Our aim is to make you a more efficient and productive</strong><br><strong>data scientist by teaching you how to leverage the power of</strong><br><strong>the command line.”</strong><br>I like the command line, I’m interested in data science …<br>this is totally my jam!<br>Off course, I have no idea what I’m talking about.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3sHiub0">https://bit.ly/3sHiub0</a></p>
<p>2 - ‘Let’s Build a Simple Interpreter’:<br><strong>“If you don’t know how compilers work, then you don’t know</strong><br><strong>how computers work. If you’re not 100% sure whether you</strong><br><strong>know how compilers work, then you don’t know how they work.”</strong><br>I too, have no idea of what a interpreter is.<br>This might do me some good.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/">https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/</a></p>
<p>3 - Install Papis:<br><strong>“Papis is a command-line based document and</strong><br><strong>bibliography manager. Its command-line interface (CLI)</strong><br><strong>is heavily tailored after Git.”</strong><br>I, as the world renowned erudite that I am, am in dire need of<br>something that coaxes some order into my ever expanding,<br>sprawling collection of electrical tomes.<br>I have 15 books in PDF.<br>But these things are generally fun to use, and I’m going to<br>give it a try.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://papis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://papis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a></p>
<p>4 - Create a self hosted blog about Linux, Python, and how my<br>project are going and stuff:<br>Yeah, that might be fun.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/2Ynppbq">https://bit.ly/2Ynppbq</a></p>
<p>5 - Get to know SQL Alchemy:<br>In my case, get to know anything about SQL Alchemy. I flicked<br>through the documentation and it seemed, to a very hurried and<br>unfocused eye, that it could do interesting things.<br>Must study it with more care.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">https://www.sqlalchemy.org/</a></p>
